DNSMasq / FTLDNS expects to have the following capabilities available:

  - CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE: Allows FTLDNS binding to TCP/UDP sockets below 1024 (specifically DNS service on port 53)
  - CAP_NET_RAW: use raw and packet sockets (needed for handling DHCPv6 requests, and verifying that an IP is not in use before leasing it)
  - CAP_NET_ADMIN: modify routing tables and other network-related operations (in particular inserting an entry in the neighbor table to answer DHCP requests using unicast packets)

config.json
	"privileged": ["NET_ADMIN"],
	"host_network": true

Dockerfile
# Network hostmode -> change port to avoid conflict with ycast
RUN	sed -i '/^server.port/ s/80/8053/'	/etc/.pihole/advanced/lighttpd.conf*

# For network host mode, ServerIP have to be set --> https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/issues/495
# Already fixed upstream. Below should not be neccesary when implementing network host mode at some time.
#RUN    echo 'ServerIP=$(ip route get 1.1.1.1 | cut -d" " -f7)' >> /bash_functions.sh


unsolved: If host_network is set, pi-hole does not respond to DNS querys --> HA specific, does not happen with pure docker on test maschine.

check if dhcp listens to eth0 or ens1 -->

# https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/issues/720#issuecomment-765061613
docker exec -ti pihole pihole -d | grep PIHOLE_INTERFACE
    PIHOLE_INTERFACE=eth0
I'm trying to use pihole's dhcp server (using --net=host in my docker run command) but I think it's getting messed up since it's still trying to use eth0.
